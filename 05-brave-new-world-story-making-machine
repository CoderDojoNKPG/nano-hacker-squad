Somewhere in the remote areas of the Internet, a story making machine was found:

However, it looks like it's broken and the story cannot be completed when adding a second character.

1) Could you add the missing Javascript for #char-name-2?

Hint: check the JS code for #char-name-1 in the <script> tag.

2) Could you improve the story making machine to create more awesome stories?
You can add places, characters, animals, timelines, few disasters, few victories and many universes!
