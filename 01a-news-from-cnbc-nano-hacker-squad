How to replicate this?

1) I visited http://cnbc.com and picked the first article:
"Is the US in real trouble?"
http://www.cnbc.com/id/101428379

2) View the source and copy it to jsbin (html pane).
Rick-click on the page, view page source, copy the whole content and paste it into an empty jsbin in the html section.

3) Modify it until it satisfies your needs.
Then I searched for <h1 class="title">Is the US in real trouble? We&#039;re about to find out</h1>
and replaced it with  <h1 class="title">New York City faces a new disruption: Nano Hacker Squad</h1>

Can you come up with a better article for CNBC?

As an exercise, write up a small article that looks like coming from CNBC.
For extra bonus, try changing the images too (search some at http://images.google.com)
