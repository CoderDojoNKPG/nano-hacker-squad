So far we have a nice selection of names to choose from (some are very cool names)
// This is a continuation of: http://jsbin.com/bucun/1/edit

We have almost a voting application working:
http://jsbin.com/dodiz/3/edit

We are missing the function to compute all the checked marks and print the winner and count of votes.

This weekend is the deadline to modify the jsbin to include your food names and voting privileges!

Could you make this application work?
