I have uploaded the code combining seriously.js green screening and web camera and it's on a github repo:

Http://www.github.com/pedroha/seriously-camera

The page should be live at:
Http://pedroha.github.io/seriously-camera

Try downloading the ZIP file from the repo (or even better clone the repo) to your local machine.
https://github.com/pedroha/seriously-camera/archive/master.zip

Inspect what piece of code and images will need to change in order to change the backgrounds.

If you want to test locally, you'll need to run some web server. On the Mac, you can type on a terminal window after changing the directory to your folder:

python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Then you can open your browser:
Http://localhost:8000

Another option to run a web server is through node.js and it will work on mac, windows, and linux.
