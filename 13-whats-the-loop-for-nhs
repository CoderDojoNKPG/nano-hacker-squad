Searching for the right sound for the NHS is not a trivial task.
Besides searching for sound files at freesound.org, you can google for "wav downloads"
Ex: "siren wav download"

There's this clunky sequencer found at this location.

Basically, you can compose multiple tracks that play at the same time.

When you click on "play", you'll hear the "music" (sort of music, not really)

Steps:
1) Find a couple of very short sound effects and create a 4-track player (instead of the current 2-track player).
2) Find another couple of very short sound effects and replace the two that were in the original code.
3) Compose the binary digits for each of the tracks to create a masterpiece that represents the multi-track loop for NHS.

You'll realize that you cannot upload sound files to jsbin, so I needed to point to remote resources. In my case, I uploaded them to github and I can reference them from jsbin.

Few other sound files I uploaded to my github repo (from freesound.org)
