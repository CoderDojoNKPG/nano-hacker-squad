A very secretive hacker group, known as the Nano Hacker Squad, is working on a secret project: discover the colors of the NHS.

So far this is the work in progress:

We've been eavesdroping on a FUN project to "borrow" some code.

Your mission, should you accept it, it's to explore and discover the right colors for NHS and put back the colors.

  Instructions:

    a) Find the RGB colors for the class .nhs at the bottom of the style pane (see reference at the bottom)

      .feature-box-image.nhs {

          background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4);255
            }


              b) Fix the 3 missing blocks to complete the word NHS and restore piece to the hacking world.

              Good luck!
