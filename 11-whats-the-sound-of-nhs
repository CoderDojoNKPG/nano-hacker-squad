Perhaps, now it's the time for the public to hear about NHS (Nano Hacker Squad)
What better way than making very loud sounds?

Why don't you explore the sound possibilities at http://freesound.org
(You'll need to create an account. Or you can use mine: quieutquiet/happy.sound)

Check out the jsbin (I hosted my sound resources in github):
http://jsbin.com/quviwelo/1/edit

1) Let's pick different sound clips to play (short percussions, drum work well) from freesound.org

2) Upload your sound files

jsbin (and similar) are great at sharing code (HTML/CSS/JS), but not graphics and sound files.
You'll need to host these in another web location.
You can upload all your files to a free web hosting service such as http://www.neocities.org
(When creating a neocity account, make sure not to forget your passwords: email it to yourself!)
