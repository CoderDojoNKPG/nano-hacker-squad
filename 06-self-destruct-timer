By popular vote, it was deemed necessary to have a self-destruct timer for future missions.

There's a working countdown timer:

It works great when there are 60 seconds or less; however, once we have more than 60 seconds, we'd like to display the following format: MM:SS, where MM are the minutes and SS are the remaining seconds.

1) Let's change the timeRemaining:

    var timeRemaining = 100;

    and check the effect.

    2) We might want to review a Brave New World to display multiple spans with different values.
    See if you can figure out how to display in the HH:MM format.

    Hint: You will need few mathematical operations: % (modulus remainder operator) and Math.floor()

    Warning: this exercise is a little more advanced than any example we have seen so far.
    Hence, you will likely need more help from mentors. Bring questions on Sunday!
