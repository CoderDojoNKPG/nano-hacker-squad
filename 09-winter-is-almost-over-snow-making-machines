We have retrieved an example on how to draw snowflakes on <canvas>

http://jsbin.com/hiromofa/edit

There's a function snowflake() which is called five times. We are using recursion to draw it.

Given this example, recreate a whole scene with snowflakes of recursion level 3 and 4 such as:
   snowflake(c,3,475,125,125);  // More snowflake-like
      snowflake(c,4,625,125,125);  // This looks really fractal!

      Try 5 large snowflakes. Why about 100 smaller ones placed randomly?
      Try different colors for the snowflakes.

      To make it more interesting, how about using setInterval() to animate all of these snowflakes?

      Let's make a colorful winter scene before spring shows up.
