This exercise is inspired in Mario's trials on his binary converter.

We have a binary converter (from decimal to binary). Binary means base 2. Decimal is base 10.

1) Could you come up with the other way, from binary digits to decimal?

2) How about changing the base to 8?

3) Can you make it work for base 16 (known as hexadecimal)
