We found some code that produces a nice grid color:

Could you make the changes to produce something like this?

Exercise:
// 1. Double the size of the canvas (width, height), and of the rectangles.
// 2. Shrink the width to half of the height for each block
// 3. Add another set of 6 columns (colors don't matter for now)
// 4. Fix the colors now!
