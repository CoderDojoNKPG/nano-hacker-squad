This time, we are in the New York Times!

My steps:
1) Visit the New York Times: http://www.nytimes.com
2) Pick any article. I picked: http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/25/world/europe/ukraine.html?hp&_r=0
3) Right-click, view page source, copy all
4) Open an empty jsbin page and paste into the HTML page.
5) Replace the title, in my case: "Ukraine’s Acting Government Issues Warrant for Yanukovych’s Arrest"
to: "New York City faces a new disruption: Nano Hacker Squad".

Exercise:
Repeat the same process, change the content of the article (write about the kickoff meeting? or What a hackathon is). Find some different images and replace!

You'll notice that the page changes to two different views: desktop (very wide), mobile view (when it's narrow).

This is called responsive web design.
