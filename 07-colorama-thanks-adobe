Choosing "beautiful" color combinations for the NHS has been taking too much time.
Hence, let's leverage our partner (and victim): http://kuler.adobe.com.

Steps
1) Visit: https://kuler.adobe.com/explore/most-favorite/
2) Open Console:
    a) Web-Inspector (right click on the page and inspect element, then select the "Console" tab at the top)
    3) Copy/Paste the JS code from:
        https://gist.github.com/pedroha/5886899

            to the "Console" of Adobe Kuler's web page.

            4) Explore different color combinations: pick any two of the RGB colors and plug it to your NHS page.
