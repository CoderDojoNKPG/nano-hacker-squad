We got most of the code for a piano interface (sort of)

But some keys are missing. Can you complete all the other keys?

We are using the function constructor to create multiple instances that are similar objects.

For instance, A can be described as:

var A = {
freq: 440,
      type: 0,

      play: function() {
        if (this.oscillator) this.stop();
        this.oscillator = context.createOscillator();
        this.oscillator.connect(context.destination);
        this.oscillator.frequency.value = this.freq;
        this.oscillator.noteOn(0);
      },
stop: function() {
        if (this.oscillator) {
          this.oscillator.disconnect(0);
          this.oscillator = null;if}
      }
};
