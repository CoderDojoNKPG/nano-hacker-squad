Now, you might get started getting familiar with all the JS family.

You have already met jquery.js. Now, it's two.js. JS stands for Javascript.

There was a fun two.js example I found at:
http://www.javascriptoo.com/two-js

But I wanted to make it run on jsbin, so I needed a remote URL for two.js.
http://jsbin.com/yeluge/1/edit

I found the remote URL for two.js while visiting a website with a whole JS mafia: http://cdnjs.com/

And searched for two.js:
http://cdnjs.com/libraries/two.js/

We have a larger rectangle with random colors too:
http://jsbin.com/xibuy/1/edit

Your mission:
1) Change the sizes and colors of each example.
2) Replace the circle with an ellipse (documentation: http://jonobr1.github.io/two.js/#basic-usage)
3) Add a polygon. (same reference as above)
4) Search for an SVG image on google and add it to the drawing
