Can the Nano Hacker Squad stop time? By controlling time, we can control the universe!

This exercise is based on a question by Olivia in reference to the analog clock example.

How would I make a pause button work?

---

The secret is in the "now" variable and "sec", "min", "hr" variables.

You want to to have your own separate "sec", "min", "hr" variables that are not tied up to "now" all the time.

var now = new Date();
var myClock = {
    sec: now.getSeconds(),
        min: now.getMinutes(),
            hr: now.getHours()
            };

            We'll need another boolean variable, say "paused", that will tell us to increase our variables or not.

            var paused = false;

            This is the high-level Logic:

            Timer logic: every second, if "paused" don't do anything, if NOT "paused" then add "1 second" to our myClock.

            function incrementClock() {
                myClock.sec = myClock.sec + 1; // increment seconds!

                    // What happens when seconds reach 60?
                        // What happens when minutes reach 60?
                            // What about hours?

                                return myClock;
                                }

                                function clock() {
                                    if (paused) return;

                                        var time = incrementClock();
                                            var sec = time.sec;
                                                var min = time.min;
                                                    var hr = time.hr;

                                                        // Same drawing piece.


                                                        The final piece is how do we change the state of the "paused" variable?

                                                        We'll need another HTML button, say "PAUSE", that will toggle the value between "true" or "false".

                                                        This is the jsbin that includes the many pieces mentioned in the

                                                        http://jsbin.com/kuvufoxe/21/edit


                                                        Realize that's not complete. The hand for the seconds is working, but the hands for minutes and hours are not.

                                                        See if you can complete the TODO section.

                                                        Hint: You'll need to use the IF conditions.

                                                        if (myClock.sec === 60) { // if seconds reach 60
                                                         .......
                                                         }

                                                         if (myClock.min === 60) { // if minutes reach 60
                                                           ....
                                                           }

                                                           I hope you all become time masters!
                                                           If we master time, we can control the universe! (At least the universe inside the computer)
